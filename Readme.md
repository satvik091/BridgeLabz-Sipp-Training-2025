## 📅 Training Progress

### ✅ Day 1 – Java Problems
- Solved basic Java coding problems to strengthen programming logic.
- Focused on:
  - Conditionals and loops  
  - Input/output in Java  
  - Writing clean and readable code  

### ✅ Day 2 – Java Fundamentals Problems
- Explored core Java fundamentals.
- Covered topics such as:
  - Data types and variables  
  - Operators and expressions  

### ✅ Day 3 – Control Flow Programs
- Practiced control flow mechanisms in Java.
- Worked on:
  - `if`, `if-else`, `else-if` statements  
  - `switch` cases  
  - Looping constructs (`for`, `while`, `do-while`)  
  - Nested conditionals and loops  

### ✅ Day 4 – Arrays in Java
- Understood the concept and usage of arrays.
- Practiced:
  - Declaration and initialization  
  - Iteration using loops  
  - Sum, average, max/min, sorting  
  - Multidimensional arrays  

### ✅ Day 5 – Strings in Java
- Gained understanding of string handling.
- Topics included:
  - String methods: `length()`, `charAt()`, `substring()`, `indexOf()`  
  - String comparison: `equals()`, `compareTo()`, `==`  
  - StringBuilder & StringBuffer for mutable strings  
  - String formatting and concatenation  

### ✅ Day 6 – Methods in Java
- Developed modular code using methods.
- Covered:
  - Defining and invoking static/non-static methods  
  - Parameter passing and return values  
  - Method overloading  
  - Reusability and code organization  

### ✅ Day 7 – Built-in Functions
- Learned to use Java’s built-in utility functions and libraries.
- Focused on:
  - Math functions (`Math.pow()`, `Math.sqrt()`, etc.)  
  - Wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Double`, etc.)  
  - Utility methods from `Arrays` and `Collections` classes  

### ✅ Day 8 – Extra Problems & Practice
- Strengthened problem-solving skills with extra challenges.
- Practiced:
  - Pattern printing  
  - Recursion problems  
  - Logical problem-solving using all learned concepts  

### 🔄 Day 9 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – *Branch: `OOps`*
- Switched to a new branch to focus on OOP.
- Covered:
  - Class & Object creation  
  - Encapsulation using getters and setters  
  - Constructor overloading  
  - Introduction to inheritance and polymorphism
