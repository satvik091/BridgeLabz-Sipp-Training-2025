  - Wrapper classes (`Integer`, `Double`, etc.)  
  - Utility methods from `Arrays` and `Collections` classes  

### ✅ [Day 8 – Extra Problems & Practice](https://github.com/satvik091/BridgeLabz-Sipp-Training-2025/tree/CoreJava/Strings/Day-8%20Problems)
- Strengthened problem-solving skills with extra challenges.
- Practiced:  
  - Logical problem-solving using all learned concepts  .

### 🔄 [Day 9 – Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)](https://github.com/satvik091/BridgeLabz-Sipp-Training-2025/tree/OOPS/Class-Object) – *Branch: `OOps`* 
- Switched to a new branch to focus on OOP.
- Covered:
  - Class & Object creation   

### 🔄 [Day 10 – Constructors & Access Modifiers –](https://github.com/satvik091/BridgeLabz-Sipp-Training-2025/tree/OOPS/Constructors-%20Access%20Modifiers) *Branch: `OOps`*
- Continued in the OOPs branch.
- Topics included:
  - Default, parameterized, and copy constructors  
  - Constructor chaining using `this()`  
  - Access control using `public`, `private`, `protected`, and default  
  - Understanding package-private visibility  

### 🔄 [Day 11 – this, static, and final Keyword Programs](https://github.com/satvik091/BridgeLabz-Sipp-Training-2025/tree/OOPS/this_static_final) – *Branch: `OOps`*
- Explored important Java keywords that influence object behavior and memory.
- Topics included:
  - Using `this` keyword for referencing current object and constructor chaining  
  - `static` variables, methods, and blocks – shared memory and utility use cases  
  - `final` variables, methods, and classes – ensuring immutability and restriction  

### ✅ [Day 12 – Object-Oriented Design Principles](https://github.com/satvik091/BridgeLabz-Sipp-Training-2025/tree/OOPS/Object%20Oriented%20Design%20Principles) – *Branch: `OOps`*
- Continued OOP exploration by understanding design principles.
- Topics included:
  - SOLID principles (Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov, Interface Segregation, Dependency Inversion)  
  - DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself) and KISS (Keep It Simple, Stupid) principles  
  - Cohesion and coupling concepts  
  - Applying these principles in real-world Java code
